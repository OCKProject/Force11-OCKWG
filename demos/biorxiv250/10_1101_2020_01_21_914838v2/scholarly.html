    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p id="p-2">The coastal rock pool mosquito, 
     <em>Aedes togoi</em>, is found in coastal east Asia in climates ranging from subtropical to subarctic. However, a disjunct population in the Pacific Northwest of North America has an ambiguous heritage. Two potential models explain the presence of 
     <em>Ae. togoi</em> in North America: ancient Beringian dispersal or modern anthropogenic introduction. Genetic studies have thus far proved inconclusive. Here we described the putative ancient distribution of 
     <em>Ae. togoi</em> habitat in east Asia and examined the climatic feasibility of a Beringian introduction into North America using modern distribution records and ecological niche modeling of bioclimatic data from the last interglacial period (~120,000 BP), the last glacial maximum (~21,000 BP), and the mid-Holocene (~6000 BP). Our results suggest that suitable climatic conditions existed for 
     <em>Ae. togoi</em> to arrive in North America through natural dispersal as well as to persist there until present times. Furthermore, we find that ancient distributions of suitable 
     <em>Ae. togoi</em> habitat in east Asia may explain the genetic relationships between 
     <em>Ae. togoi</em> populations identified in other studies. These findings indicate the utility of ecological niche modeling as a complementary tool for studying insect phylogeography.

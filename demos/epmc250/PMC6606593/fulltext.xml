Here, we show how stratigraphy is being made in a lake that is heavily impacted upon by climate change and human activities. For one of the largest inner-Alpine catchments in the European Alps, we draw attention to how sedimentation rates are a product of non-stationary, reflexive, human actions. In Lake Geneva, we identify both a human-induced climate change (HCC) signature and the effects of a recent economic shock on sediment extraction upon sediment loading to and sedimentation rates in the lake. The HCC signature thus reflects the nature of climate change impacts in this basin, where sediment accumulation rates evolve with climate, but where economic conditions contribute to shifts in the supply of sediment to the lake. Following social theory, we call this glocalization because of the combined importance and inseparability of human impacts across different spatial scales. The nature of human impacts on sediment delivery to the lake mean that the influence of humans is unlikely to be captured in the long-term depositional record.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Hydrology</kwd><kwd>Limnology</kwd><kwd>Sedimentology</kwd><kwd>Geomorphology</kwd><kwd>Climate-change impacts</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x00026;amp;#x00F6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung (Swiss National Science Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII2_147689</award-id><award-id>CRSII2_147689</award-id><award-id>CRSII2_147689</award-id><award-id>CRSII2_147689</award-id><award-id>CRSII2_147689</award-id><award-id>CRSII2_147689</award-id><award-id>CRSII2_147689</award-id><award-id>CRSII2_147689</award-id><award-id>CRSII2_147689</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lane</surname><given-names>S.

If it is to be geologically-defined as an epoch that follows the Holocene, it must be grounded in the Geologic Time Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and research has shown that over the last 200 years there has been a transition in depositional records. In the Holocence, records reflect the globally diachronous human impacts on landscapes and sediment systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The Anthropocene has increasingly synchronous global impacts of greater magnitude than previous epoch transitions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and a marked acceleration of impacts from the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Although there is clear evidence of markers that suggest significant human forcing of the Earth System (new materials of anthropogenic origin, species extinctions and mixing, changes in the abundance of natural materials)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, the case for sedimentation rates is less clear and some have argued that sediment systems have yet to be significantly transformed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. This is perhaps not surprising because human impacts on sediment flux to depositional sites can be opposing. For instance, humans have dramatically increased global soil loss to the oceans due to agriculture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> whilst simultaneously impounding many rivers, which has reduced sediment flux substantially<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The balance between these opposing processes is likely to be regionally, even locally specific. There is a rich and spatially-differentiated variety of human impacts on river basins, with histories that may not be convergent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> in a way that would lead to a globally synchronous change in sediment balance, positive or negative, which might then be seen in the depositional record. That said, there are very few decadal-scale source-to-sink studies of what is driving the Anthropocene depositional record, and almost none in large river basins (&#x0003e;1000 km<sup>2</sup>).</p><p id="Par3">In the 1990s, the word &#x0201c;glocalization&#x0201d; became a marketing buzzword, derived from Japanese business studies from the 1980s, to describe the development and marketing of global goods and services to different local markets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Social theorists developed this concept to criticise a growing assumption that globalization would lead to the obliteration of local impacts on social change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Glocalization has come to indicate: (a) the interaction of (social) processes at different scales, from those that were global and increasing spatial homogeneity to those that were local and increasing spatial heterogeneity; and (b) how these processes, both global and local, evolved autogenically, through self-regulation, in response to these interactions. Thus, glocalization recognizes that spatial differentiation in social processes will continue in societies despite strong globalising forces and that this differentiation will also evolve through time.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we present evidence that supports the use of the notion of glocalization to frame human impacts on sedimentary systems in the Anthropocene. We illustrate this through quantifying how human-induced climate change propagates through a heavily human-impacted Alpine landscape, to change sediment delivery and sedimentation rates in Lake Geneva. We use the stratigraphic record from this lake to infer temporal and spatial patterns of sediment accumulation rates and grain size. In the upstream Rh&#x000f4;ne valley, which is the corresponding sediment source, we collect data about the provenance of the sediment, sediment fluxes, volumes of gravel extraction and perturbations of water and sediment fluxes in response to hydropower management practices. We show that a global signal related to changes in HCC-driven glacial melt is clearly visible, both in the sediment fluxes upstream of Lake Geneva and in the sediment accumulation pattern within the lake. However, grain size and sediment supply patterns have strongly been modified in response to economic and other forces in the region, with a rate of change that is unlikely to lead to centennial and longer-term, systematic changes in lake sediment stratigraphy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chronology of river engineering in the Rh&#x000f4;ne basin, climate warming and glacial response</title><p id="Par5">Lake Geneva is the sedimentary sink of the 5&#x02019;338 km<sup>2</sup> Alpine Rh&#x000f4;ne basin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), that ranges in altitude from 372 to 4&#x02019;634&#x02009;m a.s.l. It has a basin-wide average precipitation of 1&#x02019;400&#x02009;mm per year and unit runoff of 1&#x02019;060&#x02009;mm per year. Given the altitudinal range of the basin, significant amounts of precipitation fall as snow in winter and there is <italic>c</italic>. 730 km<sup>3</sup> of accumulated ice, mainly above 2&#x02019;500&#x02009;m a.s.l.

The Alpine Rh&#x000f4;ne river has been subject to significant human impacts, notably over the last 150 years. Two major phases (1863&#x02013;1894 and 1930&#x02013;1960) of engineering transformed a 103&#x02009;km length of the largely anastomosing-meandering main stem into a narrow single-thread channel within dykes. The Rh&#x000f4;ne and its main tributaries have been engineered to disconnect their main channels from their floodplains and to convey delivered water and sediment through to the delta. During the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and notably between 1950 and 1975, 1.2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup> m<sup>3</sup> of reservoir storage was introduced (e.g. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and, to increase water storage, hundreds of kilometres of inter-basin transfer tunnels were drilled. The basin is responsible for 0.44% of global hydropower potential, despite covering only 0.0041% of the global land surface. About 20% of the mean annual runoff goes into storage. The completion of the major phase of reservoir storage expansion in the 1960s was coincident with a slowing, and eventually a very slight reversal, of post Little Ice Age climate warming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This was sufficient to slow retreat rates in all glaciers and lead to glacier advance by the early 1980s in many cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

The first was the distribution of dams, which are primarily located in the Penninics (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). <sup>10</sup>Be-based denudation rates were some of the highest for the Penninics (1.23&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.71&#x02009;mm&#x02009;yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, where there is also significant ice cover (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). It is well established that glaciers are extremely efficient erosive agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and there is growing evidence that their ability to evacuate eroded sediment is increasing due to climate driven changes in glacial hydrograph shape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>; but sediment fingerprinting and mixing modelling suggested that tributaries located in the North and the East (External massifs) of the catchment were generating more of the sediment transported by the Rh&#x000f4;ne river to Lake Geneva<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Even though the External massifs had lower denudation rates (0.81&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.39&#x02009;mm&#x02009;yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, only the western External massif basins were impounded (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) such that, as climate warmed and glacial sediment supply increased, at least some of the glacial signal would be able to reach the basin outlet.</p><p id="Par11">Second, many of the un-impounded Penninic and some of the External massif basins are also impacted by hydropower but with extracted water transferred laterally through tunnels to storage reservoirs in nearby valleys (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, yellow). Given high rates of sediment production in glaciated basins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and to avoid the abstraction of too much sediment, the intakes have small gravel and coarse sand settling ponds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The coarse-grained material (sand fractions and coarser) is temporarily stored in these settling ponds and only washload is transferred to storage in reservoirs. When full, the sediment from the intakes is flushed down the river, which can be many times a day during peak summer ice melt. Data about flushing frequency provided by the hydropower company and the analysis of these records for 6 representative Penninic basins (I, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) show that flushing frequency; (1) rose markedly from the 1970s through the 1980s to 1994 (Mann Kendall, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05); (2) had no significant trend from 1995 to 2009 (Mann Kendall, at p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05); after which there was a marked jump in the number of flushes per year (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). The average number of flushes per year was significantly lower (t-test, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) for the period to 1986 (111&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;17&#x02009;yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) than for 1987 to 2014 (188&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;18&#x02009;yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to 191&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;18&#x02009;yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, see Methods for explanation). The greater flushing frequency (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>) is seen in both increased sediment delivery to Lake Geneva (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b,c</xref>) and accumulation rates in the lake (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) since 1987. Flushing maintains sediment connection to downstream reaches; calculations of sediment budgets suggested that despite more than 95% flow being removed from the river at intakes and routed towards the storage reservoirs through tunnels, approximately 25% of flushed sediment went into river and floodplain storage immediately downstream. The remaining 75% of this flushed material found its way further downstream, thus maintaining significant sediment flux to the Rh&#x000f4;ne River despite the abstraction of 95% of water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. This sediment connection would thus allow the climate impact on ice melt and sediment export (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>) to be propagated through the system (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b,c</xref>) not least because greater ice melt means greater sediment load and hence an increased flushing frequency. Indeed, there was a correlation of 0.543 (Pearson&#x02019;s <italic>r</italic>, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) between flushing frequency and suspended sediment load. This relationship is also aided by the Rh&#x000f4;ne straightening and dykes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), which have largely eliminated overbank flows and so floodplain sedimentation, allowing a stronger connection between delivery of sediment from upstream and the lake.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Gravel mining</title><p id="Par12">Whilst the above argument suggests that a heavily hydropower-modified system was able to maintain sediment connectivity to downstream, there is one final intriguing result. There is some evidence that sediment mining in the Alpine tributaries can impact downstream sediment load even in a basin of this size. Although extracted sediment includes fractions that would not be transported in suspension, the annual rate of sediment extraction was only slightly lower in magnitude that the loading of suspended sediment to Lake Geneva. Up until the late 2000s there was a negative relationship between sediment extraction rates and both mean annual sediment concentration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, Pearson&#x02019;s <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.617, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, 1989&#x02013;2009) and suspended sediment load (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, Pearson&#x02019;s <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.395, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, 1989&#x02013;2009) to Lake Geneva. We modelled this relationship for 1989-2009 using simple linear regression, used the model to predict concentrations and loads for the entire period for which we have extraction data, 1989&#x02013;2014, and plotted the differences between modelled and observed extraction rates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g,h</xref>). The negative relationships shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> for data until 2009 suggest that despite extraction data including both sand and gravel fractions, sand extraction was sufficient to be observed in downstream concentrations and loads of suspended material. However, from 2009 onwards, annual sediment concentrations and loads become independent of extraction rates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and the residuals for both concentration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>) and load (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>) are no longer distributed around zero but strongly positive, suggesting that extraction no longer influences them. There is a marked association with the flushing data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). Sediment mining appears to be sufficient to reduce loading to Lake Geneva significantly until 2009 explaining the significant declines in load and concentration to between 1994 and 2009. However, extraction then appears to decouple from concentrations and loads and this was coincident with a significant economic downturn, and slow-down in construction rates, reported to begin from the end of 2008 by the Swiss sediment mining industry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Mean annual suspended sediment concentration (<bold>a</bold>) and annual suspended sediment load (<bold>b</bold>) versus total sediment extraction.

Whether the depositional signal of the last few decades that we address in this paper does indeed get incorporated into the permanent stratigraphic record will depend on its preservation potential. Whilst deposition rates in Lake Geneva are high close to the river mouth (cores TS-14, TS-8, TS-9, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), this is also the zone of an active canyon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Whilst the active canyon has not migrated over the last century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, it is likely to migrate over longer timescales. In the distal sub-lacustrine delta (cores TS-4, KK-1, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), away from the river mouth and the active canyon, where preservation potential is highest, depositional rates were substantially lower<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In the zone of highest preservation potential, we identify a signal that for the moment can only be identified using micro-techniques (e.g. microscopes). However, this signal is also non-stationary, with a period of lower sedimentation until the mid-1980s, followed by a rise from the mid-1980s. A primary reason for this non-stationarity is that human impacts on sediment flux to the delta, whether related to global climate change (here increasing ice melt and sediment supply) or water and sediment management (here related to hydropower, river management and sediment extraction) are potentially opposing and evolve through time. On the one hand, evidence suggests that climate warming is driving glacial melt-driven sediment export<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This can still be seen downstream of dams and intakes because the hydropower system operation is strongly coupled with climate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>); as climate warming produces more ice melt, it also produces more sediment, and hence a greater need to flush intakes. On the other hand, until the economic shock of 2008, sediment extraction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>) seemed to grow with sediment supply (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>) and this was sufficient to cause lower concentrations and loads at the Lake during the 1990s and early 2000s (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Sediment extraction has partly desensitised sediment delivery to the Lake from upstream climate warming. Yet, these relationships are also non-stationary. Here, an external economic shock slowed the growth in sediment extraction rates from 2009 onwards just as there was growing sediment export from glaciated parts of the basin. The result was a very rapid rise in sediment concentration and loading to the highest values on record (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b,c</xref>). Given the close relationship between ice melt and glacial sediment export<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, it is likely that as the ice volume in the basin declines and a state of &#x0201c;peak water&#x0201d; is passed, here predicted for the 2030s to 2050s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, so annual sediment delivery will reduce. This process may also be reinforced by the progressive reduction in sediment availability in deglaciated zones as the landscape passes through its paraglacial phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. It is this combination of HCC with human impacts within the basin that can: (a) result in opposing tendencies; (b) make sediment delivery prone to external shocks; and (c) involve co-evolution of drivers (e.g. climate, human response) within the system.</p><p id="Par14">Our data show that the exact nature of human impacts on the processes that influence sediment depositional environments will have substantial variability, within and between basins, as well as through time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Although evidence of a &#x0201c;golden spike&#x0201d;, that is a sudden stratigraphic break, is clear for a number of markers (new materials of anthropogenic origin, species extinctions and mixing, changes in the abundance of certain materials)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, indeed we use such a marker ourselves to estimate mass accumulation rates in Lake Geneva in this paper, the case for sedimentation is much less clear. As others have argued, whilst sediment systems are being significantly transformed by human activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, this is unlikely to be globally coherent and synchronous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. It is perhaps remarkable that short-term sedimentation rates respond so rapidly to global forcing and the speed of response means that the human signal in sediment delivery to Lake Geneva is unlikely to be stationary for sufficient time (decades and longer) to be seen in significant changes in sedimentary layers. The richness and complexity of human impacts, and the reflexive capacity of humans to respond to those impacts, is at once broadening the spatial-scales (impacts of global temperature rise; large-scale hydropower investment; global economic shocks) but collapsing the time-scales over which global change becomes recorded; and leading to high non-stationarity in the depositional record. We argue that it is these changing space and time-scales that distinguish the Earth System in the Anthropocene as compared with previous epochs. It will likely be very hard to define an Anthropocene stratigraphic unit (e.g., a member or a formation) based on sediment stratigraphy alone.</p><p id="Par15">Our example is not the only one to support the reflexivity of human impacts. For instance, in one of the most impounded countries in the world, the USA, awareness of the environmental impacts of dams, including upstream sediment accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and downstream sediment starvation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, is leading to both flood releases to re-establish sediment flux and dam removal. Such changes are likely to re-establish the impacts of human activity on soil erosion, downstream sediment deposition and reverse current rates of delta sinking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We propose the concept of glocalization as the means of conceptualizing the opposing, co-evolving and non-stationary signatures of human impacts on sedimentation rates. Glocalization occurs in four ways: (1) global processes (e.g. rises in greenhouse gas concentrations and global increase in temperatures paired with larger ice melt; economic downturn) have regional and local scale manifestations (here in terms of Alpine climate change; changes in demands for extracted sediment); (2) the river basin itself conditions the impact of these processes (e.g. where sediment can be eroded, whether sediment compartments are connected, and whether sediment can be transported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>); (3) humans modify these processes (e.g. dams, intakes, flushing, storing and mining). In addition, and most interestingly (4) these modifications are reflexive, whether implicitly, such as built into infrastructure (e.g. increases in intake flushing frequency forced by changing climate) or explicitly, here as the downturn in the construction industry in the late 2000s slowed the growth in sediment extraction rates, so reducing mining impacts on sediment concentrations and loading to Lake Geneva, and leading to very high suspended sediment concentrations and loading to the Lake. As a framing of the Anthropocene, the term glocalization gains its explanatory power not simply because it recognises that the stratigraphic record is going to be a product of both global processes and their conditioning by local effects; but also because it emphasises that interactions between different scales in a human-impacted world are continual and reflective; an additional kind of autogenic response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> to the forcing of erosion and sediment transport through river basins that arises from physical, chemical or biological processes. We do not deny the dramatic impacts that humans are having on sediment flux over large areas and short timescales. However, we argue that it is highly unlikely that such impacts will last for long enough to be detectable in the sedimentary record. We must therefore avoid na&#x000ef;vely searching for globally synchronous human impacts upon rates of sediment deposition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Climate data</title><p id="Par16">Climate data were provided by MeteoSuisse on a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2&#x02009;km grid with a daily resolution.

For regulatory reasons, each intake has to record precisely the volume of water (in m<sup>3</sup>) that is abstracted. Thus, each has a broad-crested weir that has been calibrated to provide discharge data. However, once an intake is full of sediment, it has to be flushed, and this can be many times per day for the bigger basins with large glaciers (notably the Haut Glacier d&#x02019;Arolla and Tsijiore Nouve, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). When the intake is flushed, the discharge falls rapidly and such drops can be seen clearly in discharge records (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">M5.1</xref>). In almost all cases, flushing is related to the intake being full or nearly full with sediment and hence by counting the number of flushes per year, we can get an index of the level of activity in the upstream basins. There is an exception to this, for the Haut Glacier d&#x02019;Arolla and Tsijiore Nouve, the operator introduced a different intake management system from 2008. For safety reasons, from this year, rather than waiting for when the intake was full, the intake was flushed at 23.30 each evening provided the intake was at least half full. This will increase the number of flushes recorded. Hence, from 2008 onwards, we calculate a range of total flush numbers, a maximum assuming that Haut Glacier d&#x02019;Arolla and Tsijiore Nouve were full at evening flushing, and a minimum assuming they were only half full at night time flushing. The method used to identify flushes for the Haut Glacier d&#x02019;Arolla, detailed in (29) is used for all other intakes except Tsijiore Nouve, where the method is detailed in (26).

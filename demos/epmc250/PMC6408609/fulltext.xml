habitat-forming species through physiological effects and through changes to ecological interactions, with projected trajectories for ocean warming and acidification likely to exacerbate such impacts in coming decades. Interactions between habitat-formers and their microbiomes are fundamental for host functioning and resilience, but how such relationships will change in future conditions is largely unknown. We investigated independent and interactive effects of warming and acidification on a large brown seaweed, the kelp <italic>Ecklonia radiata</italic>, and its associated microbiome in experimental mesocosms. Microbial communities were affected by warming and, during the first week, by acidification. During the second week, kelp developed disease-like symptoms previously observed in the field. The tissue of some kelp blistered, bleached and eventually degraded, particularly under the acidification treatments, affecting photosynthetic efficiency. Microbial communities differed between blistered and healthy kelp for all treatments, except for those under future conditions of warming and acidification, which after two weeks resembled assemblages associated with healthy hosts. This indicates that changes in the microbiome were not easily predictable as the severity of future climate scenarios increased. Future ocean conditions can change kelp microbiomes and may lead to host disease, with potentially cascading impacts on associated ecosystems.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acidification</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>disease</kwd><kwd><italic>Ecklonia radiata</italic></kwd><kwd>holobiont</kwd><kwd>temperature</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Australian Research Council</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP140102776</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>February 13, 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Climatic change is affecting biodiversity at a global scale [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the marine realm, ocean warming and acidification are driving regime shifts whereby dominant habitat-forming species, such as corals and large seaweeds, are being replaced by less complex and less productive habitats, affecting biodiversity [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSPB20181887C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Understanding the mechanisms that underpin these climate-driven shifts is critical to properly manage and conserve marine ecosystems [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Ocean warming and acidification can have direct physiological effects on habitat-forming species, negatively affecting their performance and survival [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (but see [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Often, marine regime shifts are driven by indirect effects of these stressors via changes in species' interactions [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSPB20181887C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, studies typically focus on interactions among macroorganisms, such as competition (e.g. acidification influencing turfs-kelp interactions) and predation (e.g. warming leading to kelp grazing by range-expanding herbivorous fishes) [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], while interactions between macro- and microorganisms receive much less attention [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Despite their potential importance, little is known about the impacts of ocean climate change on interactions between macro- and microorganisms. While it is clear that microorganisms are critically important for the normal development and functioning of eukaryotic hosts [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], environmental stressors can disrupt the strong relationship between hosts and their associated microbiomes (defined here as an assemblage of microorganisms), leading to dysbiosis and host disease [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSPB20181887C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hosts and their associated microbiomes form a coherent biological entity&#x02014;&#x02018;holobiont&#x02019;&#x02014;that must be studied together to properly understand biological systems and how they will be impacted by climate change [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is particularly crucial for habitat-forming organisms, because impacts on these holobionts can affect entire ecosystems [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>On subtidal temperate rocky reefs, kelps (macroalgae of the order Laminariales) are the dominant habitat-forming species, providing food and shelter to many organisms, and playing a critical role in primary production and ecosystem functioning [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Key habitat-forming kelps are, however, declining in many places around the world due to impacts of multiple stressors, including climate change [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As a consequence, these systems typically shift from complex and productive forests to simpler, less productive habitats, with significant impacts on ecosystem services [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The kelp <italic>Ecklonia radiata</italic> (hereafter <italic>Ecklonia</italic>) forms extensive forests that dominate subtidal rocky reefs along 8000 km of temperate and sub-tropical Australian coastline [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSPB20181887C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], a region coined &#x02018;the Great Southern Reef&#x02019; that provides ecosystem services with an estimated value of more than A$10 billion per year [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Critically, <italic>Ecklonia</italic> forests are declining in several areas across the continent due to direct and indirect effects of ocean warming, as well as poor water quality around urbanized shorelines [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These forests are predicted to decline further under future climatic conditions in response to warming and acidification [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Interactions between <italic>Ecklonia</italic> and its associated microbiome may contribute to, or even underpin, these declines. Recent surveys throughout the latitudinal distribution of <italic>Ecklonia</italic> identified putative disease phenotypes that were common and widespread. For example, kelp bleaching and associated tissue degradation were quantified in approximately 50% of the individuals in the populations sampled when water temperatures were warmest [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Bleaching in <italic>Ecklonia</italic> is related to changes in the associated microbiome and increases in abundances of putative pathogens, resulting in a lower photosynthetic capacity of the affected tissue [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Negative interactions between associated microbiomes and host health have also been observed in other, co-occurring Australian seaweeds (e.g. the red seaweed <italic>Delisea pulchra</italic> and the fucoid <italic>Phyllospora comosa</italic>) [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], where microbial diseases lead to striking changes in fecundity [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or survival [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>We experimentally tested the independent and interactive effects of ocean warming and acidification on the associated microbiome and condition of <italic>Ecklonia</italic>. We hypothesized that increases in water temperature and decreases in pH (simulating ocean acidification) would lead to changes in host-associated microbial communities and to diminished condition of the host (i.e. lower photosynthetic efficiency or disease symptoms similar to those observed in the field [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]). We found that tissue of some kelp blistered and subsequently bleached and degraded during the experiment as a result of warming and/or acidification. We then characterized the structure of the microbiome associated with blistered and healthy kelp to examine effects of kelp condition, warming and acidification on microbiomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>(a)</label><title>Mesocosm experiment</title><p><italic>Ecklonia</italic> individuals (sub-adults, mean biomass 162 &#x000b1; s.e. 13 g; maximum length approximately 30&#x02013;60 cm) were haphazardly collected from Charlesworth Bay (30.2677&#x000b0; S, 153.1435&#x000b0; E), Coffs Harbour, Australia, by detaching the holdfasts from the substratum. All collected individuals appeared healthy with no obvious signs of disease or stress. <italic>Ecklonia</italic> individuals were exposed to warming and acidification in twelve flow-through, fibreglass mesocosms (1100 l, 1.35 m diameter &#x000d7; 0.90 m high) located outdoors and under a shade cloth at the National Marine Science Centre (30.3022&#x000b0; S, 153.1189&#x000b0; E), Coffs Harbour, Australia (see [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). The experiment included two orthogonal factors: <italic>warming</italic> (current [approximately 21&#x000b0;C] versus future [approximately 23.5&#x000b0;C]) and <italic>acidification</italic> (current [pH<sub>NIST</sub> = approximately 8.17, pCO<sub>2</sub> = approximately 400 &#x000b5;atm] versus future [pH<sub>T</sub> = approximately 7.97, pCO<sub>2</sub> = approximately 685 &#x000b5;atm]; details in electronic supplementary material, table S1), with each combination of treatments randomly assigned to 3 mesocosms. Ambient conditions represented the approximate average ocean conditions when the experiment was undertaken (July&#x02013;early August 2014, <uri xlink:href="http://www.metoc.gov.au/">http://www.metoc.gov.au/</uri>) and the future conditions corresponded to RCP 8.5 model predictions for 2081&#x02013;2100 [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Each of the 12 mesocosms housed six kelp. The holdfast of each kelp was attached to mesh at the base of a mesocosm with cable-ties fed through silicone tubing to avoid stipe damage [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Each mesocosm received filtered seawater (50 &#x000b5;m) at 3 l min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> that was pumped from the adjacent ocean, with the inlet located at the site of kelp collection. This flow-through rate ensured that the entire volume of each mesocosm was replaced multiple times a day. Thus, microorganisms in the water would have been continuously refreshed throughout the experiment as in natural conditions. Water temperature was controlled using heater/chiller units (Aquahort Ltd) and pH was manipulated by bubbling in ambient air or CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched air via a gas mixer (PEGAS 4000MF). The mesocosms experienced natural daily fluctuations in temperature and pH, which varied consistently across treatments, maintaining treatment differences (electronic supplementary material, table S1). Water temperature, conductivity and pH were measured daily in each mesocosm using a Hach HQ40d multi probe calibrated with NIST buffers.

We showed that ocean warming and acidification can rapidly affect kelp-associated microbiomes, kelp condition and performance. Kelp individuals developed blisters on the laminae and this putative disease was more prevalent on individuals under acidification treatments. Blistered tissues had lower photosynthetic efficiency and subsequently bleached, similar to phenotypes previously observed in the field [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and degraded. Given that changes in the microbiomes were rapid and preceded the observed changes in the tissue by several days, this suggests that predicted ocean warming and, in particular, acidification may have strong negative impacts on populations of <italic>Ecklonia</italic> via disruptions of its associated microbiome. Given the ecological role that this species plays along the temperate Australian coastline [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], such impacts may affect entire coastal ecosystems.</p><p>The prevalence of blisters on kelp was strongly influenced by acidification. This may be due to direct, physiological effects of this stressor on the kelp, which could have led, in turn, to changes in the microbiome and disease, although some blistering was also observed in other treatments albeit in significantly lower numbers. Alternatively, changes in the microbiome may have been a direct response to acidification at the beginning of the experiment, and may have subsequently led to blistering of the kelp. Changes in kelp-associated microbiomes were observed before changes in the condition of the kelp, suggesting an indirect effect of acidification on kelp condition, that is, via changes in the microbiome.</p><p>Of particular interest was, however, the finding that microbial community structure associated with blistered tissue differed markedly from that associated with healthy tissue in most treatments except for the combination of future temperature and acidification (i.e. the future scenario), where microbiomes resembled those on healthy kelp. These results may be caused by ocean warming and acidification having independent, yet antagonistic effects on microbial communities. As more studies simultaneously test for the impacts of ocean warming and acidification using factorial designs, it is becoming increasingly apparent that warming and acidification have independent effects on biological response variables, rather than interactive effects (e.g. [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). When the direction of the effects of ocean warming and acidification oppose each other, they tend to moderate, rather than exacerbate, the impacts of ocean climate change [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. While these types of opposing effects have been demonstrated for univariate biological response variables (e.g. coralline growth/health [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]), our data suggest that this could also be the case for entire microbial communities. Alternatively, it is possible that the microorganisms initially responsible for affecting the condition of the host were unable to withstand the combination of warming and acidification. This model is interesting as it implies that some of the currently known marine microbial pathogens may be less infective (or not infective at all) under future, more stressful environmental conditions [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, the exposure to such conditions will be gradual, rather than abrupt as in this short-term experiment, allowing for evolutionary processes to take place [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Indeed, microbial communities can have the capacity to adapt rapidly to changing environmental conditions [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It is therefore possible that both host and microbiome may gradually adapt to the future ocean warming and acidification conditions modelled in this study, making predictions based on short-term studies such as this one challenging. Small-scale, short-term experimental manipulations are a powerful tool to determine causality, but it is hard to generalize observed effects in such experiments, particularly where other trophic levels and/or large-scale processes (e.g. ocean currents/eddies) are ignored. Combining short-term experiments with longer-term field sampling, or using space-for-time substitutions at appropriate locations [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], can help to reduce uncertainties and improve forecasting.</p><p>Environmental changes have been linked to microbial diseases in other key habitat-formers including corals [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and our understanding of negative host&#x02013;microbiome interactions on seaweeds is increasing [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Microbial diseases have recently been characterized in stressed populations of habitat-forming seaweeds in SE Australia, including the red alga <italic>Delisea pulchra</italic> (bacterial disease) and the canopy-forming fucoid <italic>Phyllospora comosa</italic> (endophytic fungal disease), in response to warming and around urbanized areas [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSPB20181887C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Such diseases can affect survival, photosynthetic efficiency, fecundity and influence greater consumption and host-use by herbivores [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In previous studies, we have identified putative pathogens and found a strong relationship between the structure and composition of microbiomes and host performance for <italic>Ecklonia</italic> throughout its latitudinal distribution in Australia [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], combined with an increase in kelp bleaching with temperature [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Thus, ocean warming may lead to increased frequency and severity of bleaching in <italic>Ecklonia</italic> via direct physiological impacts combined with a disruption of the microbiome. Apart from observing changes in microbiomes in response to warming in the present experiment, we did not detect any measurable effects of temperature on the prevalence of kelp blistering (numbers of blisters). This could be partly a function of quantifying the number of blisters rather the overall area of tissue impacted because, as the blisters grew in size, they coalesced with other blisters to form larger affected bleached areas similar to those observed in the field when water temperature is warmest [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, quantification of the total area affected may have also potentially revealed an effect of temperature. Alternatively, this could be due to kelp already experiencing similar temperatures at the end of summer or during localized heatwaves. Kelp may be more resilient to warming than acidification, although recent studies show that exposure to warm temperatures similar to the one used here can affect kelp condition and survival leading to significant kelp declines [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Additionally, different stages in the life history of kelp are likely to respond to environmental changes differently, and thus responses by adults may not reflect those by early life stages (e.g. recruits), which can be less tolerant.</p><p>The putative disease&#x02014;blistering, bleaching, tissue degradation&#x02014;observed here could have resulted from a mesocosm effect (i.e. moving kelp from the natural environment into mesocosms), although numbers varied among treatments. We were not able to sample field populations at the time of the experiment to assess blistering or bleaching levels; however, we have observed kelp bleaching and tissue degradation in many <italic>Ecklonia</italic> populations along the continent [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], not related to photobleaching or tissue loss following reproduction, but which resembles the bleaching and degradation that followed the blistering in this experiment. Similar diseases have been observed in other seaweeds in the field, for example gall/blister development and discoloration on fronds of the fucoid <italic>Durvillaea antarctica</italic> in Chile in response to parasite infections [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This and the higher prevalence of blistering and subsequent bleaching of kelp in treatments simulating future ocean conditions suggest that the putative disease observed in our mesocosm experiment is likely to occur in natural populations. Alternatively, kelp may be primarily influenced by acidification rather than temperature, and may only become prevalent in the field once the ocean becomes more acidic. As with all mesocosm experiments, interpretation of results may be affected by the nature of the mesocosm, relative to the natural environment. Here, some effects could have been due to an increased probability of colonization of pathogens from the water (which were not monitored) onto the kelp surfaces, such as if warming and/or acidification would have led to an increase in water pathogens. However, any such confounding issues are unlikely for several reasons. First, previous studies have shown very distinct communities in the water from those associated to any live surface, including <italic>Ecklonia</italic> [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. It is unlikely therefore that changes in the microorganisms in the water, if any, would have resulted in changes in the surface-associated communities. Second, the entire volume of each mesocosm was replaced multiple times a day with water collected from the kelp-collection site. Thus, microorganisms in the water would have been continuously refreshed, reflecting natural changes in the site where the kelp was collected. In addition, differences between treatments were due to differences in relative abundances of taxa already present on the kelp surfaces, rather than differences in presence or absence of taxa.</p><p>Differences among treatments were driven by abundances of approximately 20% of the OTUs, of which even fewer showed large effect sizes (less than 5%). The presence of a small &#x02018;core&#x02019; set of taxa associated with differences in host properties is consistent with other studies on marine microbial diseases [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and on seaweed-associated microbial communities in general [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Several taxa identified belonged to genera or families of marine pathogens associated with bleached <italic>Ecklonia</italic> and/or <italic>Delisea</italic> [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], as well as diseased sponges and corals [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] (e.g. <italic>Vibrio</italic>, <italic>Alteromonas</italic>, <italic>Aquimarina</italic>, Flavobacteriaceae and Rhodobacteriaceae), suggesting that multiple taxa may cause changes in host condition. Some of these strains have been used in inoculation experiments with <italic>Delisea</italic> which showed that multiple opportunistic pathogens can cause bleaching disease [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Similar experiments are necessary to establish a causal link between the observed changes in abundances of these and other taxa, and functional changes and the development of blistering in <italic>Ecklonia</italic>. Although our focus has been on surface-associated microbiomes, it is possible that endophytic microbes may also be responsible for the blistering/bleaching or other diseases [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], but little is known in this respect for <italic>Ecklonia</italic>.</p><p>Contamination can be an issue in microbial studies. We controlled for this in part by PCR (negative) controls and the use of sterile equipment and aseptic procedures, which in amplicon sequencing studies reduce the likelihood of contamination, and are standard and accepted practice in mensurative or manipulative studies [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In our experiment samples were collected, extracted, amplified and sequenced randomly; thus, any potential contamination in the sterile commercial kits or throughout this process would have affected all treatments in an unbiased way. The specifics of our results also argue against confounding by contamination. For example, for such contamination to influence the reversion of treatments under future climatic conditions to current ones, there would have to have been contamination from marine bacteria at a sufficient level in pre-sterilized kits in all samples of the future conditions treatment, that matched the specific community composition of the communities in the treatments subject to current climatic conditions. Therefore, it is very unlikely that observed differences of communities/taxa among treatments were due to contamination.</p><p>Host-associated microbial communities can have critical roles in the normal development, functioning and defence of marine organisms [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181887C63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. There is increasing evidence that disruptions of ecological interactions between hosts and their microbiomes can negatively impact host health and performance, reinforcing the idea that these biological associations (host and microorganisms) should be studied holistically, as &#x02018;holobionts&#x02019; [<xref rid="RSPB20181887C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSPB20181887C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This is particularly important for habitat-forming holobionts that form the biogenic structure of ecosystems (e.g. trees, kelp, corals) because impacts on the interaction between these hosts and their microbiomes can affect entire ecosystems.

# Demonstrations of automated literature search and analysis

To analyse the hundreds of thousands of articles on climate change we have created Open Source tools for automated:

* downloading
* searching by keywords
* display 

of Open Access articles in repositories. These demos have a very small subset of the available material but shouled be enough to illustrate the approach.

## Repositories

* **EuropePMC** . This is a European version of PubMedCentral and uses the EPMC server to download in bulk. We use `getpapers` , developed by Rik Smith-Unna for 
contentmine.org which issues a query, retrieves the metadata and then downoads variants of the fulltext,

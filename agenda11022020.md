It's now 2020. By 2040, only twenty years away, the earth's atmosphere will have reached&ndash;the already baked in&ndash;1.5&deg;C temperature increase. ([IPCC 2018](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/))

One of the few tools that we have for preventing further increases in global warming is human knowledge&mdash;research.  The idea that this knowledge is not in free circulation and behind paywalls for reasons of profit, self-interest, or complacency must change now.

Time is of the essence and every year counts. OCK's mission is 'action now' for open research. We are using Peter Murray-Rust's data mining software 'OpenNotebook' to analyse different areas of publishing and Open Science to make plans for this speedy transition and for the imlementaion of a new type of 'Open Science Publishing'&mdash; with all parts of the research cycle open and semantically connected.

**Invitation to join the OCK Force11 working group or contribute to the efforts in other ways.**

*All parts of meeting will be public:* video and audio recording, and minutes. If you do not want to be recorded on video please let us know and you will not appear in the public copy of the video recording. Contact: simon.worthington@tib.eu
